# Polygonization algorithm
There is currently oonee polygonisation algorithm implemented, but the plan is to supprt multiple and custom polygonisation algorithms.
<!-- Cutom, C++ interfaces for custoomised code, -->

## On Ohtakee-Belyaev algorithm
The first one is the [1] below.

1. Ohtake & Belyaev 2002 [1]
2. Ohtake, Belyaev & Pasko 2003 [2]

It is the only algorithm implemented as of as of March 2021.

It is implemented compltely. Some minor customisations are added for improving.
* (details to be specified)
