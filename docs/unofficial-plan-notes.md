* Use `autodiff` for symbolic mathematics in C++
   * Latest progress: compiles. [Snippep](https://github.com/sohale/implisolid/blob/d7856f21df8d470a1096fa146a79ba2b410547de/sandbox/autodiff/implicit-functions/cpp/autodiff-sample1.cpp) with a minimal usage example of aautodiff (full e2e script)
   * The idea is to export glsl functions (as an overrided method of the class?)

* A simple `autodiff`-based glsl visualiser (also see `symmpy`)
   * Maybe: online gcc-compile server?
   * Stash / sanadbox of developmental implicit functions (for people with repos? a package manager in style of: atom/npm/templlator)


* Create a demo folder with a glsl demo for some simple SDF
  * First, a simple glsl demo
  * 2, Run a simple SDF on that panel
  * Later on (vision/telos!): develop a sandbox for python-based.
  * Sets the stage for autodiff-basaed and sympy-based.

* A `sympy`-based glsl visualiser
  * Use `sympy` (Python) for exploring new implicit functions (As a branch of investigation.
  * Exports `.glsl`
  * Use separaate C++ autodiff for the other branch: C++-based sybolic mathematics. But Keep the sympy alive.
  * A demo page (view only)
  * (Maybe) a demo page that serves python?
  * autodiff-basaed and sympy-based ecosystems (See Stash/sandbox above).
