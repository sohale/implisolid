* Use autodiff for symbolic mathematics in C++
   * Latest progress: compiles. [Snipped](https://github.com/sohale/implisolid/blob/d7856f21df8d470a1096fa146a79ba2b410547de/sandbox/autodiff/implicit-functions/cpp/autodiff-sample1.cpp) with a minimal usage example (full e2e script)
   * The idea is to export glsl functions (as an overrided method of the class?)
   * Maybe: online gcc-compile server?

* Create a demo folder with a glsl demo for some simple SDF
  * First, a simple glsl demo
  * 2, Run a simple SDF on that panel
  * Later on (vision/telos!): develop a sandbox for python-based.
  * Use `sympy` (Python) for exploring new implicit functions (As a branch of investigation.
  * Exports `.glsl`
  * Use separaate C++ autodiff for the other branch: C++-based sybolic mathematics. But Keep the sympy alive.
  * A demo page (view only)
  * (Maybe) a demo page that serves python?
