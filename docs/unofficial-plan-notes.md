* Use autodiff for symbolic mathematics in C++
   * Latest progress: compiles. [Snipped](https://github.com/sohale/implisolid/blob/d7856f21df8d470a1096fa146a79ba2b410547de/sandbox/autodiff/implicit-functions/cpp/autodiff-sample1.cpp) with a minimal usage example (full e2e script) 

* Create a demo folder with a glsl demo for some simple SDF
  * Use sympy for exploring new implicit functions (As a branch of investigation.
  * Use C++ auatodiff for the other branch: C++-based sybolic mathematics
